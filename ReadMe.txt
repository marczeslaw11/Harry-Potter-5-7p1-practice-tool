Program sees only files in folder C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Electronic Arts\Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\HPOOTP
with name starting with "HPOOTP ". 
Text written in blue Entry box will be used as a name to file created with button below
(the file's name will be "HPOOTP " + Entry text). 
If no name provided, program will create new file with integer in the end of name,starts counting from 0. 
If file with provided name exists, the file gets replaced. 
The default path is to my folder (sorry),so if you're not Marek, please enter user's name before doing anything else.
If you want to replace file without closing game, please do it while being in the main menu, before clicking "continue game",
I have no idea what bugs can it cause.
